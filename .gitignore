# The ".flattened-pom.xml" file is generated by the Maven Flattener plugin.
# This plugin allows you to create a simplified, flattened version of your Maven project's POM file.
# The flattened POM file includes all the dependencies and their versions directly in the file,
# rather than referencing them in separate dependency management sections.
